# TheTDatabase
 Database template made for Hood Rat Snacks
 
 This Database holds 5 tables named Orders, Customers, Items, Inventory, and Batches
 This template allows the company to keep track of these tables and update them as need be.
 
 The UI isn't the prettiest, but it is all functional except Download Tables.
 Upload tables writes an XML and an XMLScheme called HRS.xml and HRSScheme.xml in the default application directory.
 The other tabs can show the different tables, and inside the different table views you can update and add table rows without extra information abouts the tables.
